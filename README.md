# CodeGeneratorMVC
Creates starting project files based on an MSSQL Script. This is being converted from an internal Win Forms project written in VB.Net we wrote years ago to an MVC C# .Net Core web application. We used this project to scaffold the starting framework for large projects. 

*Original Conversion of VB.Net to C# was done by using the Telerik Converter: https://converter.telerik.com/ *
